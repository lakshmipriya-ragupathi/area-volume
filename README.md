# area-volume
## calculate area and volume of various shapes<br/>question:
The Area class has side, length, breadth, and radius as private data members. It has a square, rectangle, and circle public function that calculates and returns the area of the respective shape. If the parameters of a shape are not given, it calculates the unit area of the respective shape.
 
<br/>The Volume class has height as a private data member. It has cube, cuboid, sphere, compare cube, compare cuboid, and compare sphere public member functions. The compare volume function prints which among the two volumes is greater than the other.

<br/>Utilize the concepts of this pointer, friend function, inline function, and default parameters wherever necessary (minimum 1 of each concept)
